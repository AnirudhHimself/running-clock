# Introduction

I created this because I like having a tab on my browser open that displays a running clock. It's a React SPA (literally, it's a single page) that has a stopwatch. It saves the start time in local storage, so if you close the tab, it'll still remember how much time has elapsed. As time ticks, it updates the document title so you always know how much time has gone by.
